Project Description
---
This project was built as part of Powerhouseâ€™s SunCode Challenge 2017. We set out to build an application tailored to PV site developers that enable selection of specific modules and material sets. Using a machine learning model created by our Data Scientist- Anatoly Pavlov(https://github.com/AnatolyPavlov), we created an optimization tool for Solar developers to pinpoint the most efficient battery operation TOU and carrying capacity.
